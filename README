Marauroa
--------

Marauroa is a implementation, using Java, of Arianne, but we are also 
extending some of the concepts implemented in Arianne to improve it.

Marauroa wants to be a massive multiplayer role playing game that you can 
access through your internet connection. It is a virtual world, and you have
an unprecedented degree of freedom to shape your own destiny. Social 
interaction, combat, or just hanging out with friends will all be parts of 
your experience.

Marauroa is also a Massively Multiplayer Engine, that you can use to build 
you own online games using Marauroa as a Content Management system.

You can find the latest version of Marauroa at: 
http://marauroa.sourceforge.net

Marauroa is a GPL project.

Version
-------
0.10 version 

Status
------
Marauroa is NOT playable.
It is now running a server that implements the FULL protocol and that is
able to connect to a MySQL database, also features the RP Engine in its 
first state.

Next version will contains a very simple game: Tic-tac-toe, implemented 
using the Marauroa engine.

Requirements
------------
Actually to compile Marauroa you need:
- Java SDK 1.4.2	( http://java.sun.com )
- JUnit 1.3.8		( http://junit.sourceforge.net )
- Ant 1.5.4		( http://ant.apache.org )

In order to get it working with MySQL you also need:
- MySQL Connector/J ( http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html )



Build
-----
You need ant properly installed on your system to build Marauroa.
Once you have ant running, simple move to marauroa directory and run ant.
Before running ant you need to edit build.xml in Marauroa to point to correct 
Junit.jar file.

  <property name="junitlib" value="../../../classes/junit.jar"/>

Then save and run ant.

cd /foo/bar/marauroa
ant jar

You will have a marauroa-<version>.jar file in the lib folder.


Running
-------
Use the BAT files to run it:
- marauroad [-c configurationFile] is the server 
- JMarauroa is the client

Edit marauroa.ini to use JDBC Database.
Please refer to docs/JDBC Database HOWTO.txt

Read simpleGame about how to play it.
