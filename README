Marauroa
--------
Marauroa is Arianne's Multiplayer Online Engine, that you can use to build
your own online games using Marauroa for object management, database persistence
and perception based client-server communication.


Extended Description
--------------------
Marauroa is completely written in Java using a multithreaded server architecture
with a TCP oriented network protocol, a SQL based persistence engine and a
flexible game system based on open systems totally expandible and modifiable
by developers. 

Marauroa is based on a philosophy we call Action/Perception, on each turn a
perception is sent to clients explaining them what they perceive and clients
can ask server to do any action in their names using actions.
Marauroa is totally game agnostic and makes very little assumptions about what
are you trying to do, allowing a great freedom to create whatever type of game
you want.

You can find the latest version of Marauroa at:
http://arianne.sourceforge.net

Marauroa is a GPL project.


Requirements
------------
To actually compile Marauroa you will need:
- Java SDK 1.5 http://java.sun.com
- Ant 1.6 http://ant.apache.org

In order to get it working with MySQL you will also need:
- MySQL Connector/J http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html

- JUnit 4.4 in order to run test cases.
- Jython for Python support.


Build
-----
Make sure ant ( http://ant.apache.org/ ) is installed.
Now just write:

  ant jar

Or for a complete package release write:

  ant



You need to grab a game package in order to be able to play it.


Running
-------
Ok, you have compiled Marauroa. Now what to do?

Well, if you have built a Marauroa server it is because you
want to play with the server either because you want to run your own
game server or because you are a developer wanting to develop your own game.
If you don't understand the above it is likely that you are looking for
http://arianne.sourceforge.net instead.

Testing
-------
In order to test Marauroa with JUnit you need to setup a MySQL database:
 
  Database: marauroatest
  username: junittest 
  password: passwd
 
You can do that by doing:

  create database marauroatest;
  grant all on marauroatest.* to junittest@localhost identified by 'passwd';

Also please copy src/marauroa/test/server.ini to main project folder.

  cp src/marauroa/test/server.ini .  
  

Changelog
---------
3.8.1
- added new method ClientFrameWork.sendKeepAlive for keeping the connection open more than 10 minutes in the character selection state pre game
- added new method DBCommandQueue.getOneResult

- multi protocol version support for database storage
- added ability to RPClass.bake() the RPClass to speed up performance.

Please see http://stendhalgame.org/wiki/Marauroa_3.8 for details on those features

3.7
- Note: Make sure that you place the player into the world in RPRuleProcessor.onInit() and not in RPObjectFactory.transform
- character list now includes the RPObject to provide details if the network protocol version is >= 32
- improved performance by processing client message outside the PlayerEntryContainer lock
- added detailed error message if a transaction is accessed from another thread


3.6
- added number of unique ips to statistics in addition to number of players
- provided an infrastructure for asynchronous database access (not used at all places yet)


3.5.1
- fixed reading of size from the network stream in case it was split over multiple packets

3.5
- limit number of parallel connections from one ip-address, see http://stendhalgame.org/wiki/index.php/Configuration_file_server.ini#Limits
- limit account creation per ip-address in a timeframe, see above
- fixed null values on H2 in account.timedate and gameEvents.timedate

3.2

- automatically add new columns in existing database tables
- improved logging


3.1
- always hash the password based on UTF-8 instead of the plattform default encoding on login

  encoding was not UTF-8 and the password contained special characters)
- made method dumpOpenTransactions public so that games can use it for debugging and monitoring
- moved periodic saving of players out of buildPerceptions so that it gets it on performance profiling index
