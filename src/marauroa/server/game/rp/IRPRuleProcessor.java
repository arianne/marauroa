 * <p>
 * This interface is the key to extend Marauroa to match your game needs. First
 * we have setContext that allows us complete access to RP Server Manager, so we
 * can control some things like disconnect players or send them stuff. It is not
 * possible to access GameServerManager or NetworkServerManager directly to
 * avoid incorrect manipulation of data structures that could place the server
 * in a bad state.
 * <p>
 * onActionAdd, execute, beginTurn and endTurn allow you to code behaviour for
 * each of these events. You can control whenever to allow player to add an
 * action to system, what system should do when it receive an action and what to
 * do at the begin and end of each turn.<br>
 * Perceptions are delivered just after endTurn is called.
 * <p>
 * Also your game can handle what to do at player entering, player leaving and
 * decide what to do when player timeouts because connection has been dropped
 * for example.
