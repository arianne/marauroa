/**
 * The GameServerManager is a active entity of the marauroa.game package, it is
 * in charge of processing all the messages and modify PlayerEntry Container
 * accordingly.
 * <p>
 * The logic is similar to this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   GameManager
 *   {
 *   NetworkManager read Message
 *
 *   switch(Message type)
 *   {
 *   case ...;
 *   }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * So let's define the reply to each message. First, let's clarify that the best
 * way of modelling this system is using finite automates, (a finite state
 * machine) where, based on the input, we change the state we are currently in
 * and produce an output.
 * <p>
 * Login
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Process C2S Login ( STATE_BEGIN_LOGIN )
 *   Precondition: The state MUST be NULL
 *
 *   Test if there is room for more players.
 *   if there is no more room
 *   {
 *   reply S2C Login NACK( SERVER_FULL )
 *   state = NULL
 *   }
 *
 *   if check username, password in database is correct
 *   {
 *   create clientid
 *   add PlayerEntry
 *   notify database
 *
 *   reply S2C Login ACK
 *
 *   get characters list of the player
 *   reply S2C CharacterList
 *
 *   state = STATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *   notify database
 *
 *   reply S2C Login NACK( LOGIN_INCORRECT )
 *   state = NULL
 *   }
 *
 *   Postcondition: The state MUST be NULL or STATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE
 *   and a we have created a PlayerEntry for this player with a unique clientid.
 * </pre>
 *
 * Choose Character
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Process C2S ChooseCharacter ( STATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE )
 *   Precondition: The state MUST be STATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE
 *
 *   if character exists in database
 *   {
 *   add character to Player's PlayerEntry
 *   add character to game
 *   reply S2C Choose Character ACK
 *
 *   state = STATE_GAME_BEGIN
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *   reply S2C Choose Character NACK
 *   state = STATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE
 *   }
 *
 *   Postcondition: The state MUST be STATE_GAME_BEGIN and the PlayerStructure
 *   should be completely filled or if the character choise was wrong the state is STATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE
 * </pre>
 *
 * Logout stage
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Process C2S Logout ( STATE_GAME_END )
 *   Precondition: The state can be anything but STATE_LOGIN_BEGIN
 *
 *   if( rpEngine allows player to logout )
 *   {
 *   reply S2C Logout ACK
 *   state = NULL
 *
 *   store character in database
 *   remove character from game
 *   delete PlayerEntry
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *   reply S2C Logout NACK
 *   }
 *
 *   Postcondition: Either the same as the input state or the state currently in
 * </pre>
