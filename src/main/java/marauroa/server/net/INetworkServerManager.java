/**
 * A Network Server Manager is an active object ( a thread ) that send and
 * receive messages from clients. There is not transport or technology imposed.
 * <p>
 * The Network Manager is our router that sends and receives messages to and
 * from the network. The manager exposes the interfaces that allow:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Reading a message from the network
 * <li>Sending a message to the network
 * <li>Finalizing the manager
 * </ul>
 *
 * Now lets get back to the interface as exposed to other objects.<br>
 *
 * The Write method is immediate, just call it with the message to send, making
 * sure that you have correctly filled SourceAddress and ClientID. The message
 * will then be sent to the Client.
 *
 * The Read method is blocking, when you call the Read method it either returns
 * a message from the queue or if the queue is empty the thread blocks (sleeps)
 * until one arrives.
