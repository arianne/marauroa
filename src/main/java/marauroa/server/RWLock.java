/**
 * This class is a Reader/Writters lock A Reader Writer Lock is a
 * synchronization mechanism allowing access to data.<br>
 * It allows multiple threads to read the data simultaneously, but only one
 * thread at a time to update it.
 * <p>
 * Controlling concurrent access to a shared, mutable resource is a classic
 * problem. Clients request, and later release, either read-only or read-write
 * access to the resource. To preserve consistency but minimize waiting, one
 * usually wishes to allow either any number of readers or a single writer, but
 * not both, to have access at any one time.
 * <p>
 * While a thread is updating, no other thread can read the data. The name is
 * misleading. It may cause you to think there are two locks; in reality there
 * is a single lock that restricts both reading and writing.
