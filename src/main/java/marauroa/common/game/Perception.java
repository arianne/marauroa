/**
 * The Perception class provides a encapsultated way of managing perceptions. It
 * is the core implementation of the Delta^2.
 * 
 * Perception manages added, modified and removed perceptions. The basic
 * structure for sending world updates to clients is called perceptions. There
 * are two types of perception:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sync perceptions<br>
 * these are used to synchronize clients with the server world representation.
 * This is the only valid way of knowing world's status.
 * <li>Delta perception<br>
 * this is used to send only the changes to the world since the last perception.
 * </ul>
 * Our actual Perception system is called Delta2. It is heavily attached to the
 * Marauroa core, so I recommend you to use it :)
 * <p>
 * How Perceptions and Actions work Actions are sent from the client to the
 * server in order to make the character perform an action. In order for the
 * client to know the result of the action the Server needs to send a reply to
 * the client. How will this be done?
 * <p>
 * In a first attempt, we send clients back an action that was the result of
 * their action. However, this made the code really hard because we had to
 * update two different things, perceptions and actions. Instead the solution
 * appears intuitively: Why not join action reply and perceptions.
 * <p>
 * So the action reply is stored inside each object (that executed the action )
 * with a set of attributes that determine the action return status and the
 * attributes. This way of doing replys makes it a bit harder on RPManager but
 * it simplifys the creation of new clients alot.
 * <p>
 * See RPAction reply in the RPObject documentation to know exactly what is
 * returned. However, keep in mind that the return result depends of each
 * particular game.
